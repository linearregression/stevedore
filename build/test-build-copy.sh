# Runs test for a golang package, then builds a statically-linked binary with no C dependencies or
# debugging info, from a golang package path.  The package must contain a "main".

# Usage: build-and-copy.sh git.zulily.com/core_backend/reasoning/apps/ingest
#
# Example: invoking:
#       $ build-and-copy.sh path/to/some/package@
# results in the binary being placed in: $GOPATH/src/path/to/some/package/package
